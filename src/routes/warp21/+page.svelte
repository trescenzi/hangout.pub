  The Collision
</h2>
<section>
  <p>
   In 1953, the United Nations completed construction on the largest multinational research colony ever constructed in Antarctica with two aims. First, to create a united culture to avert a third World War. Second, to take advantage of the remote setting to deepen humanity's understanding of fundamental physics. This colony of scientists, engineers, and settlers represented the best and brightest from over a dozen countries. Early the colony was hailed as a breakthrough with the adoption of shared language and the construction of a massive particle collider.
  </p>
  <p>
Multiple activations of the collider provided compelling evidence in support of the Many-Worlds interpretation. These experiments ultimately culminate with an attempt to open a hole to another dimension.  Unfortunately, as far as the world knew, the colony was lost in an all consuming explosion.
  </p>
  <p>
The experiment however was more successful than could have dreamed of; the colonists found themselves in an enormous, abandoned space station orbiting a remote star, full of alien technology. For 15 years they have adapted this alien technology for their own needs to allow them to continue with their experiments, traveling to countless galaxies and dimensions in their quest to return to Earth.

  Nexus Station

    These past 15 years the lost colony has called Nexus Station their home and their base of operations for their continued experiments. The station itself is a marvel of technology. Dizzyingly large and complex such a construct couldn't even have been imagined by the scientists as humans had yet to even put a satellite in space at the time of The Collision.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now uncertain if they'll ever return to Earth, Nexus Station is home to a new generation of humanity growing up amongst the stars.
